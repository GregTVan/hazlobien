	<h1>Batch Search</h1>
	This is where you initiate batch searches (lists of names to be searched).<br><br>

	<b>Step 1</b>: Prepare an Excel workbook in .XLSX format with a spreadsheet with column headings:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>“First Name”;  and</li>
		<li>“Last Name”;</li>
	</ul><br>
	
	If you have clients that are non-individuals, eg. companies or other types of organizations, add a third column with the heading:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>“Entity Name”.</li>
	</ul><br>
		
	Client First Names, Last Names should be inserted on separate rows beneath the appropriate heading. The First Name column should contain the client’s given name and may contain in addition: middle name; middle initial and/or nickname. The Last Name column should contain the client’s surname and may contain compound names such as Smith-Jones, al-Houthi or Ortega Morales.<br><br>

	Optionally, heading names of: “Client ID”and/or “Date of Birth” may be included if you wish to limit your search results. Adding Date of Birth in Excel date format will help reduce the volume of the search output. Client ID will be used by the Canchek system when you have elected the False Positive feature to eliminate search results that do not pertain to your clients. All other information on the spreadsheet will be ignored in the Canchek search so, in the interest of data security, other information from your client file system should be deleted from the file used for input to the Canchek Batch Search.<br><br>
	
	Client ID's apply equally to individuals and entities. Date of Birth will be ignored for entities.<br><br>

	The file may contain any number of worksheets.<br><br>
	
	Here is a sample of a spreadsheet that includes both individuals, entities, client ID's and birth dates:

	<b>Step 2</b>: Click on Administration; Configure Search and select the databases you wish to search. Note that the National Registration Database and Adverse Media cannot be searched by batch but must be searched individually in the Search screen.<br><br>

	<b>Step 3</b>: Click on Administration; Batch Search, enter an email address (this is where the search result link will be sent), and select the Excel spreadsheet (.XLSX) file or .PDF file or both as the report format you will receive. When the result email is sent, you will have 24 hours to download your report after which it will no longer be available.<br><br>

	<h1>False Positive Batch Search</h1>
	The False Positive feature is useful after your first search. You will find a number of results that do not pertain to your client(s). You may choose to mark these results through the False Positive feature of Canchek. This will suppress the results you mark so that you do not have to review them every month.<br><br>

	<b>Step 1</b>: Prepare a spreadsheet for scanning by Canchek, including a column labelled 'Client ID' and containing the client ID or unique identifier of each person from your back office system. Each person should be listed separately. The spreadsheet should look like this:<br><br>

	Entities (e.g.. corporations) should look like this:<br><br>

	<b>Step 2</b>: Submit this spreadsheet to Canchek for processing as shown below. Make sure to click the 'Excel' and 'False Positive Tracking' options as in the example.<br><br>

	If you select the False Positive Tracking feature, the spreadsheet that you send to us must contain a column with the heading “Client ID”, with a corresponding value for each name supplied. Using the False Positive feature will give you a search result file that does not contain results that you have previously marked as False Positive. Please see False Positive Tracking in Canchek Help for more information regarding this feature.<br><br>

	If you use the Last Name / First Name columns, the two columns must contain the same number of entries (i.e. each Last Name must have a corresponding First Name).<br><br>

	Your search will be processed and the results made available by secure download link to you. This process may take 2-10 minutes depending on the size of the file.<br><br>

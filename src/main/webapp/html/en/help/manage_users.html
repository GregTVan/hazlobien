    <h1>Manage Users</h1>
	If you have Administrator access, this page will appear in the list of Administration items. You can use this page to add, update and delete users authorized to access canchek.com.
	<br><br>
	If you do not have Administrator access, contact customersupport@canchek.com for assistance.

	<h2>Listing</h2>

	<img src='images/useradd.png'/><br><br>

	Please note:

	<ul>
	<li>Most users will have a <b>Role</b> of 'Standard'. You may assign users as 'Admin' if you want them to be able to access the Manage Users function.</li>
	<li>Clicking the <b>False Positives</b> checkbox will cause false positive flagging to be enabled in the adhoc Search screen. It does not affect access to the false positive feature when submitting batch queries. Most users will <u>not</u> select this option.</li>
	<li><b>eID</b> (electronic identity verification) is a supplemental product. If your firm has not subscribed to this service, this checkbox will not be available. If it is subscribed, and you select it for a user, that user will be able to view and initiate electronic identity verification requests.</li>
	<li>Select which databases you want this user to have access to. Users may change these selections themselves, via the 'Configure Search' screen.</li>
	<li>The 'Adverse Media' and 'Global PEP' databases are by subscription only. If your firm has not subscribed to this service, this checkbox will not be available.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Changing</h2>
	Click the Edit icon to edit information for a user.

	<h2>Deleting</h2>
	Click the Delete icon to delete a user. This action <b><u>cannot be undone</u></b>. If you delete a user in error, 'Add' the same user back again to resume service.

	<h2>API, SFTP and SSO Users</h2>

	Canchek customers who have elected to submit searches via our API or SFTP will see a user that exists to faciliate these types of queries. This user can be managed like any other user. For example, if you wish to change the databases included in searches
	submitted through SFTP, find the user named similar to 'XYZ Investments SFTP User' and change their database settings.
	<br><br>
	If your firm uses single-sign on (SSO), you can change and delete these users like any other. However, to setup use of SSO for the first time, or to add a new SSO user, please contact customersupport@canchek.com.

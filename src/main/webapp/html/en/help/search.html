    <h1>Search</h1>
    This is where you initiate individual searches of the Canchek database (one person or organization at a time).
    <br><br>
    Searches will based on the LEADING portion of any name (primary name, alias, entity names, CTO company, CTO related person) matching.
    <br><br>
    For example, if you search for 'TAYLOR, TAMMY', you could see something like this:
    <br><br>
    TAMMY TAYLOR<br>
    TAMMY TAYLOR-SWIFT<br>
    TAMMY-LEE TAYLOR-SWIFT<br>
    <br>
    Due to limitations in source data, CTO searches will match without regard to first vs. last name (eg. SMITH, JOHN will match to both JOHN SMITH (last name Smith) and SMITH JOHN (last name John).

    The results of your search can be printed by clicking the link in the top left above the search output. This will open a new tab in your browser with a PDF containing
    the same entries.

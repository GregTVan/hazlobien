Sanctions information is collated from all 20 sanctioned countries and includes the full line up of all individuals and entities. Canchek also includes access to all Canadian cease trade orders (CTO’s), SEDI insider trading information, domestic and international politically exposed persons (PEPs) and heads of international organizations (HIOs), National Registration (NRD), and Adverse Media.

    <b>CANCHEK®</b> adds information from official sources to help you eliminate false positives more quickly.

    <b>CANCHEK®</b> tells you what you have to do if you have a positive match to a listed person or entity, and whether you have to report the match to FINTRAC, the RCMP, CSIS and/or your principal securities regulator; supporting Regulator demands, it forms part of a comprehensive due diligence process for KYC, AML/CFT, CTOs, SEDI and PEPs.

    <h1>Adverse Media</h1>
    Canchek includes an optional Adverse Media service. The general purpose of this service is to help to identify clients who may have appeared in public news sources.
	<br>
	<br>
	This service works somewhat differently compared to the other Canchek databases. This page explains some items that you should be aware of before using this service. For further clarification, please contact 
	customersupport@canchek.com.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Adverse Media is an optional, paid service.</h2>
	While we offer a free trial of Adverse Media, due to the other factors listed on this page, we will not activate any access to Adverse Media without a specific request. Regular use of our Adverse Media service requires
	a separate subscription. This subscription is generally limited to a specific number of queries. For cost details, please contact customersupport@canchek.com.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Adverse Media comes from a US Vendor.</h2>
	Canchek purchases the Adverse Media feed on customers' behalf from a US vendor. The technical nature of this relationship requires that we submit queries to them. This means that if you use our Adverse Media service,
	your queries (eg. customer names) will be exposed to a US company. We will not expose your firm name or any other details of the customer; only their name, as supplied to us by you.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Some names will return a large number of results.</h2>
	If you open an account for somebody who shares the name of a public figure, the Adverse Media database may contain thousands of entries. Our reply will be limited to the 1,500 entries judged to be the most relevant.
	These will be returned in chunks of 20 items, sorted with the most likely relevant ones shown first. You can request additional data in units of 20.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>You cannot do batch searches on Adverse Media.</h2>
	When doing batch (eg. Excel) searches, Adverse Media is not an option, regardless of your Canchek subscription. This is due to the large number of potential results (see previous item).
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>You can search for Adverse Media about entities.</h2>
	Entities (eg. XYZ Corporation) and people (eg. John Smith) work equally well with Adverse Media.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>You can mark Adverse Media records as False Positive.</h2>
	Our False Positive function works with Adverse Media, the same as it does with other databases. However, it is not really useful because False Positive is mostly useful with batch searches, and, see previous point.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>You can do API searches that include Adverse Media, but ...</h2>
	Customers who access Canchek through our public API may see Adverse Media records if they are subscribed to this service. However, we will only return the 20 most relevant results, and, there is currently no mechanism
	to retrieve additional records through our API.

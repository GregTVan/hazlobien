                <h1>Search Results</h1>
                A Canchek search may return data from any of Canchek's seven databases, as listed below. Users may elect to search any combination of these databases. This election must be
                made in the web UI (there is no public API for this); selections are defined on a user by user basis, and apply to all forms of search (web UI, batch files, and this API).
                If a database is selected but has no search results, it will be included in the output JSON as an empty array. If a database is not selected, it will not be included in the
                output JSON at all. The following is a representative (but fictional) search result.

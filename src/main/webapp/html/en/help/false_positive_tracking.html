    <h1>False Positive Tracking</h1>
	False Positive Tracking is a feature whereby a particular match result can be flagged as resolved so that it will not appear in future scans.<br><br>

	For example, suppose that you have a client named Justin Trudeau who is unrelated to the politician and has no status as a PEP or other person of interest in the context of Canchek. You can flag this client as a False Positive, which will suppress it from appearing on future scans thus saving time and effort required to research the result. This feature is primarily of interest to firms that elect to do periodic scans of their entire client list.<br><br>

	<b>Step 1</b>: You perform a batch search with Client ID populated and receive a spreadsheet of search results. Use Excel to remove any rows that are true positives or of unknown status. At the conclusion of this process, the spreadsheet should contain only confirmed false positives. <br><br>

	<b>Step 2</b>: Go into False Positive Tracking and send this spreadsheet back to Canchek for processing, as shown here:<br><br>

	You will receive a confirmation email a few minutes later. No additional report is produced. These items will not appear on future Canchek searches.<br><br>
 
	If you find that you have marked a result that actually belongs to one of your clients, you can review the result in the Search window. Check “False Positive”in Administration; Configure Search drop down. Go to Search and enter your client First Name; Last Name or Entity Name and Client ID.<br><br>
 
	You will see a large green checkmark beside the name and clicking on the checkmark will clear the record and it will show up in future batch and individual searches.<br><br>

	Please see below for more information regarding the False Positive feature.<br><br>
